I have managed to create 19 functions out of 26. I have implemented one dimensional and two dimensional arrays as my top level arrays. And just like what Kenneth stated, storing of data is tempoary hence it requires paying attention to details to be able to link one function with the other. Lastly, my experience coding in Java has been both exciting and tiresome and i am looking forward to learn more Java and improve my coding skills.
