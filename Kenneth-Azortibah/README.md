All set up and ready to go.
The first phase of the project is hard- but no one said it was gonna be easy.
Used HashMaps to create a working log-in account system! Now, everything else...

Figured out how to use Hashsets!
The funny thing about using top-level arrays as data stores- everything is temporary. Running the code makes all prior stored information disappear.
I see how this isn't so practical, and how a much more 'permanent' method (such as storing in an external text document) might be better, but heyyy, I'm not complaining! Makes my work much easier, top-level data structures.
