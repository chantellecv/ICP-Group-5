Phase 6 - Report

First thing I noticed while getting started on Phase 6 was how easy it was to get familiar with C++.
Despite the fact that I was working in a new language, looking up the ways to say things I already knew felt easy now.

Working in C++ made me appreciate programming as a concept. 
Some structures and operations, such as loops, classes, variables, and streams, are universal; no matter what language you use.

Differences between languages do exist however, and I dance different when I work with C++.

Some ways C++ is easier than Java is how it collects input from users.
Java required the 'Scanner' class be imported first, and then an object of the Scanner class declared.
In C++ however, after the ‘iostream’ was imported, simply using the command ‘cin’, followed by << was enough to receive input from a user.
